			<h2>Personal photography showcase</h2>
			<p>I spent almost 4 years at Songkick, working across multiple product teams whilst continuing to shape the visual identity of the brand. Working closely with the UX teams, I would produce clean, usable interface designs before assisting in the development of my work. <br><br>I worked on a lot of interesting designs whilst at Songkick, hand crafting the html for all the email designs was a challenge, but a very rewarding one at that! An entire new ticketing frontend was fun, exploring anything and everything whilst carefully considering every single scenario of an event. Whilst working on new products, I did spend the majority of my time improving all four corners of Songkick.com itself. An single event listing could appear on three different pages, how would this look on them all? We'd need to display ticket options for various vendors, how do we increase conversion for Songkick sales? How big/small do we make the artist images? User research and multi-varient experments were often carried out on elements like this, which evidently shaped the look of the product.</p>
